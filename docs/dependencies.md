# Dependencies and vulnerability management

How homelab-helios chooses, obtains, tracks and updates what it's built from, and what happens when one of
those dependencies has a vulnerability.

homelab-helios's dependencies are almost entirely the **container images** it runs, pinned in
`compose.yaml`. The rest are the tools its checks and tests use and the GitHub Actions in its workflows. Its
own code, the policy checker, uses only the Python standard library.

## Choosing a dependency

A new image or tool must:

- be open source under an OSI-approved license (the services' own licenses apply to them: homelab-helios pins
  and runs them, it doesn't redistribute or link them);
- be actively maintained: releases in the last year, security issues answered, and **published for
  `linux/amd64`**, the host's architecture;
- come from the project itself, from its official registry; and
- be worth it: a new service needs a reason in the pull request that adds it.

**Exception: Plex Media Server.** Plex is free to use (hardware transcoding needs a paid Plex Pass) but not open
source. It is accepted because it is the server the household's players already use, and replacing it is a
decision about those players, not about this stack. It runs with no added privileges.

## Obtaining dependencies

| Dependency | Declared in | Pinned by | Fetched by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The stack's images | `compose.yaml` | version tag and digest | `docker compose pull` |
| Check and test tools (pytest, coverage, ruff, yamllint, shellcheck) | [`requirements-dev.in`](../requirements-dev.in) → [`requirements-dev.txt`](../requirements-dev.txt) | exact version and SHA-256 hashes (`pip-compile --generate-hashes`) | `pip install --require-hashes --no-deps` |
| Helper image for backups and the smoke test (busybox) | [`scripts/lib.sh`](../scripts/lib.sh) | version tag and digest | Docker |
| Linters and scanners used only by CI (actionlint, gitleaks, Trivy) | [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml), [`scan.yml`](../.github/workflows/scan.yml) | version tag and digest | Docker |
| GitHub Actions | [`.github/workflows/`](../.github/workflows/) | full commit SHA (version in a comment) | GitHub Actions |

Each release will carry a CycloneDX SBOM listing every service's image and digest
([verifying-releases.md](verifying-releases.md)).

## Tracking dependencies

- **Dependabot** ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml)) checks weekly for new image versions in the Compose file, new tool versions and new Action
  versions, and opens a pull request for each. Dependabot alerts and security updates are on.
- The CI-only images in `run:` steps and the scripts' busybox image aren't seen by Dependabot; they're bumped
  by hand at least every quarter.
- **Patch, minor and major updates merge automatically** once every required check has passed (CI with the Compose
  policy check and the smoke test, CodeQL, dependency review). That includes Plex, which releases often: it
  can't touch the media library, and its updates often fix security issues.
- **Major updates are read about before they're deployed**, not before they merge: a new major version can
  migrate its data one way, so the service's release notes are read, and a backup taken, before the redeploy
  that brings it to the server ([upgrading.md](upgrading.md#before-you-upgrade)). An update Dependabot can't
  classify waits for the maintainer.
- **A merge doesn't deploy.** The server runs what it last pulled; updates reach it when the operator pulls
  and redeploys, with a backup first ([upgrading.md](upgrading.md)).
- **Dependency review** blocks a pull request that adds or changes a Python or Actions dependency with a known
  vulnerability of moderate severity or higher, or a license outside the allowlist.
- **Nothing updates itself on the host.** Auto-updaters such as Watchtower are not used: they would run
  versions nobody reviewed.

## Policy for vulnerabilities in dependencies

Known vulnerabilities are found through Dependabot alerts, the services' and images' own advisories, and a
weekly scan of the pinned digests (Trivy, HIGH and CRITICAL findings that have a fix, for `linux/amd64`,
reported to code scanning). Each finding is triaged within 14 days:

1. **If a fixed version exists**, bump to it (a Dependabot pull request usually already does) and release.
   A fix for an exploitable critical or high-severity vulnerability goes out in a patch release within 30
   days; others go out with the next release.
2. **If upstream hasn't released a fix**, assess whether it's reachable in this stack (which ports are
   published, and whether anything beyond the LAN can reach them). If it is, mitigate it where possible (for
   example, an access list or not publishing a port) and say so in the release notes; otherwise record the
   reason when dismissing the alert. Either way, it's fixed by a bump when upstream ships one.
3. **If an image is abandoned** and keeps accumulating vulnerabilities, replace it.

### Current findings

Not triaged yet: the first scan runs when `compose.yaml` reaches `main`, and its triage is recorded here.

## Licenses

homelab-helios's own files are MIT-licensed. The Python tools must be under an OSI-approved license that
dependency review allows (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, PSF, MPL-2.0 and similar); yamllint (GPL-3.0) is
allowed as a development tool. The images keep their own licenses (Plex's is proprietary, see above).

## Policy for findings from static analysis (SAST)

CodeQL analyses the checker and the workflows on every pull request and weekly, and ruff runs the
bandit security rules in CI. A CodeQL finding of medium severity or higher is fixed before the next release, or,
if it is a false positive, dismissed in code scanning with a written reason. A ruff or shellcheck finding fails
CI; a deliberate exception is a per-line `noqa` or `shellcheck disable` with the reason next to it.
