# Assurance case

Why homelab-helios meets its [security requirements](security.md): the threat model, the trust boundaries,
the secure design principles it follows, and how common weaknesses are countered.

## Threat model

| Asset | Threat | Countered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The host | A compromised or malicious image | Digest pins; versions change only by reviewed pull request; no privileged, capability, host-namespace or socket access without a reasoned label (enforced by the policy check in CI and before every release) |
| The host | An internet attacker exploiting Plex, if remote access is on | Plex updates arrive as weekly Dependabot pull requests; no privileges or host namespaces; the operator decides whether remote access is on ([installing.md](installing.md#running-it-securely)) |
| The media library | A faulty or compromised Plex or AURA changing or deleting files | Only Plex and AURA mount it; Plex's media deletion off unless needed; reviewed upgrades; snapshots on the library's storage (operator) |
| The media library | A backup or restore script touching it | `/media` is in Plex's and AURA's `org.honeybeartech.helios.backup.skip` labels: `backup.sh` never archives it, and `restore.sh` refuses to write it even if a backup lists it; the smoke test checks both |
| The media | Someone watching without permission | Plex's own sign-in and sharing (operator's configuration); no "allowed without authentication" networks beyond the LAN |
| The web UIs | Someone on the LAN using Tautulli or AURA without logging in | LAN only, behind a reverse proxy's access lists; logins on where offered ([installing.md](installing.md#running-it-securely)) |
| The host | A compromised autoheal using the Docker API | autoheal never gets the socket; socket-proxy (the one `docker-socket` exception) passes on only list, inspect, restart and stop, on an internal network with nothing published |
| The host's devices | The GPU granted by running privileged | GPU only as a device reservation through the NVIDIA runtime; `privileged` refused by the policy check |
| Plex tokens, logins, certificate keys | Committed to the public repository | Kept in the services' data, never in the repo; the claim token in a gitignored `plex.env`; `.gitignore`; GitHub push protection; gitleaks over the history in CI |
| Plex tokens, logins, viewing history | Leaked through a backup | `scripts/backup.sh` writes backups readable only by the user who ran it; documented as secret, to be kept off the host |
| The services' data | An upgrade that migrates and breaks it | Backup before every upgrade; rollback = old tag + `scripts/restore.sh`, exercised against the real stack by the CI smoke test on every change |
| The services' data | A crafted backup writing outside the services' data | `restore.sh` verifies `SHA256SUMS` (which covers the `MANIFEST`), accepts only plain archive names and absolute container paths without `..`, and writes only a mount the service has read-write and doesn't exclude from backups |
| The release | Tampered release files | Keyless-signed `SHA256SUMS`, SLSA provenance, signed tags |
| The CI pipeline | Untrusted pull request input running with credentials | `pull_request` only, read-only token by default, untrusted values only via `env:`, actions pinned by SHA |
| Operator privacy | Hostnames, addresses, share names or paths in the public repo | Placeholders only; reviewed in every pull request |

Attackers considered: a compromised upstream image or registry tag; someone on the internet reaching Plex
through remote access; someone on the LAN reaching a web UI; a malicious pull request; a tampered backup; an
honest mistake in an upgrade. Out of scope: an attacker who already has root or `docker` group access on the
host, or write access to `.env`, the services' data or the media library's storage; a compromise of plex.tv or
of the Plex account that owns the server.

## Trust boundaries

1. **Registries → host.** Images are trusted only at the digest a reviewed commit names.
2. **Repository → host.** The host runs a tagged, signed release or a reviewed `main`; it never pulls code
   that wasn't merged.
3. **Internet → Plex.** Only if remote access is on; Plex authenticates every remote viewer through plex.tv.
4. **LAN → web UIs.** Plex through its own sign-in; Tautulli and AURA not published beyond the LAN,
   reached through a reverse proxy with access lists.
5. **Plex, AURA → media library.** Read-write by design; the boundary is the library's own snapshots.
6. **Containers → host.** Only each service's data directories, the media library and the GPU; no
   host namespaces, and no Docker socket except socket-proxy's read-only, filtered one.
7. **Pull requests → CI.** Fork pull requests get a read-only token and no secrets.

## Secure design principles

- **Least privilege**: no added capabilities, no host namespaces, no socket; the media only where needed; the GPU as a
  device reservation; read-only CI tokens raised per job.
- **Fail-safe defaults**: the policy check fails on anything it doesn't recognise as allowed; an exception
  needs a reason, in the file, in review. `restore.sh` refuses anything in a backup it can't account for.
- **Complete mediation**: every change to what runs passes through a pull request and the same checks;
  nothing on the host updates itself.
- **Economy of mechanism**: one Compose file, one standard-library checker, upstream images unchanged.
- **Separation of privilege**: secrets live with the services, settings in `.env`, configuration in git.
- **Open design**: the whole configuration, policy and release process are public.

## Common weaknesses

| Weakness | Where it could arise | How it's countered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CWE-494 (code downloaded without integrity check) | Image pulls | Digest pins; signed release checksums |
| CWE-798 / CWE-312 (hard-coded or cleartext credentials) | Compose `environment:`, `.env`, docs | No secrets in the repo; the claim token in a gitignored file; gitleaks; push protection |
| CWE-250 (unnecessary privileges) | Container settings, GPU access, the media mount | Policy rules `privileged`, `cap-add`, `host-*`, `docker-socket`; GPU by reservation |
| CWE-306 (missing authentication for critical function) | Web UIs without a login; Plex's unauthenticated networks | LAN only, behind access lists; logins on where offered; Plex's exemption kept to the LAN |
| CWE-22 (path traversal) | Restoring a backup | `restore.sh` validates archive names and mount paths from the checksummed `MANIFEST` |
| CWE-1104 (unmaintained third-party components) | Images, tools, Actions | Dependabot weekly; image scan; triage SLAs ([dependencies.md](dependencies.md)) |
| CWE-77/78 (injection) | Workflows, scripts | Untrusted values only via `env:`; actionlint and shellcheck; CodeQL for Actions |
| CWE-20 (improper input validation) | The checker's input | It reads JSON only with the standard library, never evaluates it, and exits 2 on anything that isn't a JSON object |

## Evidence

- CI on every change: ruff (with the bandit rules), yamllint, actionlint, gitleaks over the history,
  shellcheck, pytest with a 90 % branch-coverage floor, `docker compose config`, the
  policy check, and a smoke test on amd64 that starts every pinned image without a GPU, waits for its health
  check, round-trips a backup and restore, checks that excluded and nested mounts are left alone, and checks that
  autoheal restarts a container that turns unhealthy (a dynamic test of the stack and the scripts).
- A weekly Trivy scan of every pinned image, and on every change to `compose.yaml`, into code scanning.
- CodeQL (Python and Actions) on every pull request and weekly; OpenSSF Scorecard weekly; dependency
  review on every pull request.
