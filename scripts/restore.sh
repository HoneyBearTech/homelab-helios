# Without SERVICE, every service that has an archive in DIR is restored. The checksums are verified first, and it
# asks for confirmation (unless --yes) after listing what it will overwrite. It only writes to a container path
# the service still mounts read-write, never to the Docker socket or a path the service excludes from backups, and
# leaves the paths a service's exclude label lists inside a mount as they are. A service that bind-mounts a folder
# inside a mount being restored (ImageMaid Plex's, AURA and Kometa each other's) is stopped and started again with it,
# so it sees the restored folder. An archive goes to whatever compose.yaml mounts at its service's container path now,
# whatever source the MANIFEST names (a backup taken before CONFIG_ROOT restores into the directory under CONFIG_ROOT
# that replaced the old path): a container created from an older compose.yaml (or older settings) is recreated first,
# and a directory that doesn't exist yet is created. On a new host, restore .env from DIR/env first; the containers,
# and the volumes and directories they mount, are created as needed. Uses `docker compose` from the checkout, so the
# standard Compose variables select another project, as in scripts/backup.sh.
