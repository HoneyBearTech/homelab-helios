# the service still mounts read-write, never to the Docker socket or a path the service excludes from backups, and
# leaves the paths a service's exclude label lists inside a mount as they are. On a new host, restore .env from
# DIR/env first;
# the volumes and containers are created as needed. Uses `docker compose` from the checkout, so the standard
# Compose variables select another project, as in scripts/backup.sh.
