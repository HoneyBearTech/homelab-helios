# The unattended backup: take a backup with scripts/backup.sh, copy it off the host with rsync, keep only the newest
# few here and there, and report the result to an Uptime Kuma push monitor. The systemd timer in deploy/systemd/
# runs it nightly (docs/installing.md#scheduled-backups); it can also be run by hand.
#
#   scripts/scheduled-backup.sh
#
# Settings come from backup.env next to compose.yaml (template: backup.env.example; BACKUP_ENV_FILE names another
# file), all optional:
#   BACKUP_DIR          where backups are written (default: backups in the checkout)
#   BACKUP_KEEP         how many to keep in BACKUP_DIR (default: 3)
#   BACKUP_REMOTE       rsync destination, such as an SSH alias and directory (backup-host:/volume1/helios-backups);
#                       empty = no copy off the host
#   BACKUP_REMOTE_KEEP  how many to keep at BACKUP_REMOTE (default: 14)
#   BACKUP_PING_URL     an Uptime Kuma push URL, told "up" after a good run and "down" after a failed one
#
# Only directories named like a backup (<date>-<time>) are ever pruned, here or at BACKUP_REMOTE. A copy is complete
# once its SHA256SUMS has arrived, which is sent last; scripts/restore.sh refuses a directory without one.
