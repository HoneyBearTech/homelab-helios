# Back up the stack's state: every service's data mounts (each read-write volume or directory it mounts, such as
# Plex's or Tautulli's database; never the Docker socket, and never a path the service's
# org.honeybeartech.helios.backup.skip label excludes, such as the media library) and the settings files. Paths a
# service's org.honeybeartech.helios.backup.exclude label lists inside a mount (Plex's artwork, Kometa's assets) are
# left out of that mount's archive. Each service is stopped only while its own data is copied, so its database is
# consistent, and started again before the copy is compressed; services with nothing to archive keep running.
#
#   scripts/backup.sh [DIR]      DIR defaults to backups/<date>-<time> in the checkout (gitignored)
#
# DIR gets one <service>--<path>.tar.gz per mount, the settings (.env and any <service>.env) under env/, a MANIFEST
# naming each archive's service, container path, source and image, NETWORKS with the address range of each network
# the stack uses but doesn't create (so a rebuilt host can recreate it the same), VERSION (the checkout's
# `git describe`), and SHA256SUMS, all readable only by the user who ran it: the archives hold logins, tokens and
# private keys. Copy it off the host (scripts/scheduled-backup.sh does). Restore with scripts/restore.sh. It runs
# `docker compose` from the checkout, so the standard Compose variables (COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, COMPOSE_FILE,
# COMPOSE_ENV_FILES) select another project, as the smoke test does.
