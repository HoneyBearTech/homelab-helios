# Smoke test of the stack: start every service in compose.yaml with throwaway settings, wait until each one reports
# healthy, then mark every data mount, take a backup, change the data, restore the backup and check that the data
# and health came back (and that mounts excluded from backups were neither archived nor overwritten), make a test container unhealthy and check that autoheal restarts it (when the stack has
# autoheal), and remove everything it created. CI runs it on every change; `make smoke` runs it locally.
# Without a compose.yaml there is nothing to test, and it says so and passes.
#
# It stays away from any real installation on the same Docker host: its own Compose project, settings from
# .env.example with every directory (*_ROOT, *_PATH) moved into a temporary directory, every volume and network
# name (*_VOLUME, *_NETWORK) and name prefix (*_PREFIX) replaced by one of its own, no fixed container names, no
# published ports and no service env files. It never reads .env, ignores the stack's settings in the environment,
# and on exit removes only the volumes Compose labelled with its own project and the networks it created.
